# E-commerce

## Description

E-commerce was created in order to keep track of data for an internet retail site. Through this application, the back end of the site has been created in order to provide information based on the database. Routes have been made for the following models: categories, products, product tags, and tags. Through the routes, the user can get all information, get information by id, create a new entry, update information by id, and delete an item for each model. Please see this video which displays the functionality. To demonstrate functionality, Insomnia is used.
